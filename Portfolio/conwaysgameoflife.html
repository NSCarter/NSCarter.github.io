  <h2>CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE</h2>
  <img id="body-image" src="conwaysgameoflife.png" alt="Conway's Game of Life">
  <p>For my A-level Computer Science project, I created a simulation for Conway's Games of Life. The program had a GUI that allows users to create their own patterns or they could choose a premade pattern. You can change the size of the grid and change the speed at which the program runs. This program showed the use of object-oriented programming techniques.</p>
  <p>For this project, I also had to create a report which contained my analysis, design, implementation,testing and evaluation for my project. I had to research how the algorithm for Conway's Game of Life worked, what simulations were already available and think about how I could improve upon those that already exist.</p>

  <h2>CHATBOT</h2>
  <p>For my second university project, I had to work with a team to create a chatbot using Python. We decided to create a chatbot that would help people find their way around Coventry. We split the project into smaller tasks. One person took the input from the user and found the keywords. The next person used these keywords to look on the Internet for the relevant information. The final person took this information and put it into a sentence that would be easy for the user to read. The final person was in charge of creating the GUI and integrating the different pieces of code together.</p>
  <p>My task was to find information based on the keywords found by the first person. I used API's to connect to the Internet and find the relevant information. This was my first time using API's and I hadn't heard of them before this project but I found them very interesting.</p>

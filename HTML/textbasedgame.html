  <h2>TEXT-BASED GAME</h2>
  <img id="body-image" src="textbasedgame.PNG" alt="Text-Based Game">
  <p>For my third university project, we had to create a text-based game using C++. We decided to create a farming simulator game. The project was my first time using C++.</p>
  <p>For this project, I was in charge of creating the user inventory and shop mechanic that allows players to buy and retrieve items. We also had to connect the game to an SQL database so we could store a retrieve data when the user goes offline.</p>

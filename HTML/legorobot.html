  <p>For my first university project, I had to work with a team to build and program a Lego robot that could fight in an arena against another robot. The aim was to push the opposing robot out of the arena.</p>
  <p>The programming was a simple drag and drop. Because of my previous experience in programming, I took the lead with this aspect of the task. I had to program the sensors to detect certain things and react in a certain way. For example, we had a colour sensor that was used to detect the edge of the arena (which was a white strip). If it sensed the colour change, the robot would steer away from the edge and move back to the middle of the arena.</p>
  <p>We also used Bluetooth to connect the robot to our phones so we could activate the robot without touching it.</p>
  <p>In the end, even though we didnâ€™t win the competition, we did win a few rounds. To the left is a video of our robot (on the bottom right) competing.<p>
